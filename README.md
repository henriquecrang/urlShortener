The UI should include the following elements:

## Notes 

1 - At the start, I was decided to use VUE and Vuetify to build this project, but due to the short delivery time that I put on it, I've chosen to stay where I can swim safely, so I'll use the basics in this project and I'll compromise myself to study VUE to be comfortable with it.

2 - I decided to use Bulma to help me with te CSS. I've some previous knowledge in Bootstrap and Bulma seems more easy to understand the class system, so far so good.
